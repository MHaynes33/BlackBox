## Team Roles & Responsibilities
Our team is organized to ensure each member contributes to every phase, with clear ownership areas and shared collaboration.

| Team Member | Role | Primary Responsibilities |
|---|---|---|
| **Ayushi** | Technical Lead / ML Engineer | Leads feature engineering, modeling approach, and code structure. Ensures model reproducibility and pipeline design. |
| **Mike** | Business Analyst | Interprets interview insights and PRD context, aligns findings to business logic, writes narrative justification for modeling decisions. |
| **Colyn** | Documentation & Communication Lead | Owns formatting of reports, slide design, final written outputs, and ensures clarity of deliverables. |
| **Matt** | QA / Testing / Data Wrangler | Validates dataset integrity, performs spot-checks on model outputs, tests edge cases, and verifies correctness before submission. |

## Overview
During Phase 1, our objective was to understand the behavior of ACME Corp’s legacy reimbursement system using the provided 1,000 historical reimbursement examples (`public_cases.json`) and stakeholder interview narratives.  
The goal at this stage was not to redesign or improve the system, but to form a clear behavioral understanding that we will later replicate using machine learning.

## Dataset Reviewed
The dataset includes 6,000 records (1,000 public with reimbursement labels and 5,000 unlabeled private cases).
We examined the historical reimbursement dataset, which includes:

- **Trip Duration (days)**
- **Total Mileage**
- **Total Receipts**
- **Reimbursement Amount** (system output)

A data cleaning notebook was created to:
- Remove formatting inconsistencies
- Validate numeric ranges
- Prepare features for further modeling

_Result:_ A clean, analysis-ready dataset.

## Key Observed Patterns

| Factor | Observation | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| **Trip Length** | Reimbursement is **more generous** around **4–6 days**, declines for >7 days trips | Suggests a **sweet spot and long-trip penalty** |
| **Mileage** | Value-per-mile decreases after ~100 miles/day | Indicates a **non-linear mileage adjustment curve** |
| **Receipts** | Higher receipts do **not** consistently produce higher reimbursement | Suggests **diminishing returns and upper/lower spend penalties** |
| **Non-linear Behavior** | Adjustments change together, not independently | Legacy system likely uses **multiple interacting rules** |
| **Rounding Artifacts** | Some reimbursements show small irregularities | Suggests **bugs/features that must be preserved** |

## Phase 1 Outcomes
- We confirmed that the legacy system is **not linear**.
- We identified meaningful candidate **derived features** for modeling:
  - `miles_per_day`
  - `spend_per_day`
  - `log_miles`
  - `efficiency` indicators (balanced trip behavior)
- We created a consolidated **Business Logic Summary** aligning interview anecdotes with statistical evidence.

## Transition to Phase 2
Phase 2 will focus on translating these behavioral patterns into measurable features and establishing a baseline predictive model to approximate the legacy system.

Specifically, Phase 2 will involve:

1. Feature Engineering to capture observed effects such as efficiency sweet spots, diminishing mileage returns, and spend discipline.
2. Training baseline regression models:
   - Linear Regression (baseline reference)
   - Ridge & Lasso Regression (feature stability and noise control)
   - Polynomial Regression (to capture non-linear “sweet spot” effects)
3. Evaluating how closely these models can approximate the legacy reimbursement output and identifying where linear models fail.

The purpose of Phase 2 is to determine whether the system's behavior can be represented with smooth mathematical relationships, or whether we will require non-linear ensemble models (Phase 3) to fully replicate the rule interactions.
