# Feature Definitions and Rationales Table

The following table defines each feature used in the model, including their analytical purpose and relationship to predicting `reimbursement`.

| **Feature** | **Definition** | **Type** | **Rationale / Analytical Role** |
|:---------------|:---------------|:---------------|:------------------------|
| **trip_duration_days** | Number of days the trip lasted. | Numeric (integer) | Represents time-based expenses (lodging, meals, and daily allowances). Longer trips typically yield higher reimbursements, but with diminishing returns. |
| **miles_traveled** | Total miles traveled during the trip. | Numeric (float) | Represents travel distance, a direct component of mileage reimbursement. Strongly correlated with total receipts and total reimbursement. |
| **total_receipts_amount** | Total amount from all receipts submitted for the trip (e.g., hotels, meals, parking). | Numeric (float) | Primary monetary indicator of travel cost; a key driver of reimbursement. |
| **cost_per_day** | `total_receipts_amount / trip_duration_days` | Numeric (derived float) | Reflects average daily spending intensity — useful for identifying cost efficiency over time. |
| **cost_per_mile** | `total_receipts_amount / miles_traveled` | Numeric (derived float) | Measures spending relative to distance, highlighting differences in cost behavior for short vs. long trips. |
| **miles_per_day** | `miles_traveled / trip_duration_days` | Numeric (derived float) | Captures pace of travel. Helps explain whether long-distance but short-duration trips affect reimbursements differently. |
| **cost_ratio** | `cost_per_day / cost_per_mile` | Numeric (derived float) | Synthesizes daily vs. distance-based costs. Indicates spending efficiency balance — higher ratios suggest expensive short trips or inefficient travel. |

**Target Variable:** \| **Feature** \| **Definition** \| **Type** \| **Rationale / Analytical Role** \| \|:-------------\|:---------------\|:----------\|:--------------------------------\| \| **reimbursement** \| Total amount reimbursed or predicted value. \| Numeric (continuous) \| Dependent variable representing the final reimbursement outcome predicted by the model. \|

### Summary & Insights

All seven independent variables (`trip_duration_days`, `miles_traveled`, `total_receipts_amount`, and four derived ratios) are **continuous, interpretable, and interrelated**.

They collectively capture:

-   **Duration-based costs** → number of travel days\
-   **Distance-based costs** → mileage-related behavior\
-   **Spending efficiency** → ratios showing cost per mile/day patterns

**Insights from Feature Analysis**

-   `total_receipts_amount` and 'miles_traveled' are the strongest predictors of reimbursement.
-   `trip_duration_days` has a moderate but consistent effect.
-   Derived features like `cost_per_mile` and `cost_ratio` add context but lower direct correlation, showing indirect impact.
-   These findings confirm that the reimbursement logic is primarily driven by trip cost and travel distance — aligning with ACME’s legacy payout behavior.
