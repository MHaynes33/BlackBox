    "**ACME Legacy Reimbursement System -Machine Learning Reconstruction**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Why Interpretability Matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "ACME’s legacy reimbursement engine behaves like a black box – undocumented, nonlinear, and inconsistent according to employee interviews and PRD notes.\n",
    "Interpretability helps us:\n",
    "\n",
    "Understand which factors drive reimbursement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify the hidden rules that the legacy system was applying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare predictions with real business expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Build trust with ACME stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Validate that our ML model is replicating old logic, not inventing new rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Key Feature-Impact Findings**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using tree-based feature importance (RF + GB), permutation importance, and SHAP-style reasoning:\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Top 3 Most Influential Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "1️⃣ total_receipts_amount -Primary driver\n",
    "\n",
    "Strongest predictor across ALL models\n",
    "\n",
    "High positive correlation with reimbursement\n",
    "\n",
    "Aligns with interviews: “The system mainly pays back receipts.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Both linear and nonlinear models depend heavily on this feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tree models show breakpoints around $600–$800 and $1000+\n",
    "\n",
    "2️⃣ **miles_traveled -Secondary but significant**\n",
    "\n",
    "Mileage adds, nonlinear contribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tree models detect mileage bands (e.g., <200, 200-600, >800 miles)\n",
    "\n",
    "Suggests a legacy system applied to tiered mileage reimbursement\n",
    "\n",
    "3️⃣ **trip_duration_days- Moderate influence**\n",
    "\n",
    "Longer trips → higher reimbursement, but not proportionally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tree models show duration “tiers,” similar to per-diem rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weakly nonlinear but stable across models\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Impact of Engineered Features (Phase 2 Enhancements)**\n",
    "\n",
    "We engineered additional features to mimic possible internal business logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Engineered Feature | Explanation                    | Contribution                    |\n",
    "| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |\n",
    "| **cost_per_day**   | Spend per trip day             | Improved nonlinear fit          |\n",
    "| **cost_per_mile**  | Spend per mile traveled        | Helps handle high-mileage trips |\n",
    "| **miles_per_day**  | Efficiency of travel           | Captures unusual patterns       |\n",
    "| **cost_ratio**     | Ratio of day-cost vs mile-cost | Adds interaction context        |\n",
    "\n",
    "Result:\n",
    "\n",
    "These features improved MAE/RMSE, especially for edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "BUT did not surpass original features in importance\n",
    "\n",
    "Good for smoothing nonlinear jumps in the legacy system\n",
    "\n",
    "Validates that ACME logic was simple but nonlinear\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What the Legacy Logic Appears to Be Doing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on Phase 4 interpretability:\n",
    "\n",
