    "Model Interpretability & Feature Impact -Phase 4 \n",
    "(For ACME Legacy Reimbursement System Project)\n",
    "\n",
    "Author: Ayushi Bohra\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Why Interpretability Matters in This Project**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since ACME’s legacy reimbursement system is undocumented and behaves like a “black box,” interpretability helps us:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand which inputs influence reimbursement.\n",
    "* Compare ML behavior with employee interviews & PRD business rules.\n",
    "* Detect unexpected patterns or unintended logic.\n",
    "* Build trust with ACME business users.\n",
    "* Validate that our ML model is replicating the old system correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. **Key Feature Importance Findings**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the ensemble model (Decision Tree + Random Forest + Gradient Boosting stacked), the following features consistently ranked highest:\n",
    "\n",
    "Top 3 Influential Features (Across All Models)\n",
    "\n",
    "1️⃣ total_receipts_amount – Most Important\n",
    "\n",
    "* Strongest and most consistent predictor\n",
    "* Matches intuition: higher receipts → higher reimbursement\n",
    "* Aligns with interview hints that receipt totals drive the majority of payouts\n",
    "* Linear and tree-based models both rely heavily on this feature.\n",
    "* Also validated by Phase 1 correlation (≈ 0.85 with reimbursement)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "2️⃣ miles_traveled\n",
    "\n",
    "* Strong secondary influence\n",
    "* Tree models detected nonlinear thresholds:\n",
    "  * Mileage bands (e.g., <200, 200–600, >600 miles) affected payout differently.\n",
    "* Suggests legacy logic includes a mileage reimbursement component\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "3️⃣ trip_duration_days\n",
    "\n",
    "* Moderate but stable influence\n",
    "* Long trips → slightly higher reimbursement\n",
    "* Suggests the legacy system includes a per-diem-like rule\n",
    "* Nonlinear effects observed in tree models: short trips and long trips behave differently\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Impact of Derived Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "We engineered additional features in Phase 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "* cost_per_day\n",
    "* cost_per_mile\n",
    "* miles_per_day\n",
    "* cost_ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "Findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "* These features improved model performance.\n",
    "* But they were not more important than the core original fields.\n",
    "* Boosting models used them to capture subtle nonlinear patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "This indicates that ACME’s legacy logic was simple but had hidden nonlinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    " 4. **How the Legacy Logic Seems to Work (Inferred)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on model behavior and feature contribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "The reimbursement logic appears to be a weighted combination of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Direct receipts (primary driver)\n",
    "2. Mileage-based reimbursement\n",
    "3. A smaller adjustment based on duration\n",
    "\n",
    "This matches multiple interview hints about how employees “felt” the system worked.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    " 5. **Model Behaviors That Confirm This**\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ Linear Model\n",
    "\n",
    "* Uses strong linear relationships between receipts, miles, and reimbursement\n",
    "* Captures baseline business logic\n",
    "* Good interpretability but slightly lower accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ Tree-Based Models\n",
    "\n",
    "* Detected nonlinear thresholds similar to business rules:\n",
    "  * Mileage brackets\n",
    "  * High-receipt bonus zones\n",
    "  * Duration tiers\n",
    "* Better match to legacy behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ Stacking Ensemble (Final Model)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Balances linear insight + nonlinear precision\n",
    "* Produces predictions closest to the undocumented legacy rules\n",
    "* Provides the best accuracy, especially for high-value reimbursements\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    " 6. **Key Takeaways for ACME Stakeholders**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The legacy system heavily rewards receipt totals, with mileage as the second largest influence.\n",
    "* Duration plays a smaller role but still affects payout in a structured way.\n",
    "* The new ML model mirrors legacy behavior while revealing hidden rules.\n",
    "* The ensemble approach provides both:\n",
    "  * Accuracy (matches legacy results)\n",
    "  * Interpretability (explains why the model predicts what it predicts)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our interpretability analysis shows that ACME’s legacy system relies primarily on receipt amounts, with mileage and trip duration contributing smaller but consistent adjustments.\n",
    "Tree-based models uncovered nonlinear patterns that resemble mileage brackets and per-diem tiers described by employees.\n",
    "The final ensemble model captures both linear and nonlinear logic, providing accurate predictions while revealing the hidden business rules behind the original system.\n",
