    "- *Document Purpose*: Standardized rubric for evaluating model with consistency and against project goals.\n",
    "- *Goal*: Exact output replication, model accuracy when applied to public_cases\n",
    "- *Checklist Objectives*:\n",
    "-   Exact match reimbursement outputs(model outcomes compared to expected outcomes from public_cases.json).\n",
    "-   Avoidance of over/under fitting.\n",
    "-   Inclusion of all constructed metrics and their behavior with each model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Failure Types\n",
    "- *Low Exact Match Rate*: model does not accurately reproduce the system outcomes.\n",
    "- *Overfitting*: model memorized public dataset only.\n",

    "| Evaluation Area | Purpose |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| **Data Integrity** | Ensure inputs are valid and consistent |\n",
    "| **Feature Behavior** | Ensure engineered features capture known relationships observed in the legacy system |\n",
    "| **Core Metrics** | Ensure the model matches the legacy system's output behavior and statistical characteristics |\n",
    "| **Slice Analysis** | Detect hidden threshold breakpoints where the legacy logic changes behavior |\n",
    "| **Rounding & Quirks** | Capture and preserve edge-case artifacts, inconsistencies, and rounding patterns |\n",
    "| **Generalization** | Avoid overfitting to the public dataset and ensure stability across unseen cases |\n",
    "| **Explainability** | Ensure rules and behavior are interpretable, documented, and can be explained to stakeholders |\n",
    "| **Final Success Gate** | Decide whether the model meets reproduction requirements and is ready to move to the next phase |\n",
