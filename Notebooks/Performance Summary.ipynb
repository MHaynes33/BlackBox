    "## Comparative Performance Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate how closely the model replicates the legacy reimbursement system, we compared three evaluation metrics that capture different aspects of performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric | What It Measures | Why It Matters in This Project | Result | Interpretation |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** | Average difference (in dollars or cents) between the model and legacy output | Shows typical deviation; lower MAE means closer day-to-day matching | *X.XX cents* | Small MAE indicates the model captures core reimbursement patterns well. |\n",
    "| **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** | Penalizes **larger errors** more heavily | Reveals if a few cases are significantly off due to threshold or rounding effects | *X.XX cents* | A low RMSE suggests no large outlier mismatches; a high RMSE suggests missing rules/quirks. |\n",
    "| **Accuracy within ± $1** | % of cases where the predicted reimbursement is **within $1.00** of the legacy output | Measures practical similarity even if not exact | *XX.X%* | High accuracy here means the model approximates behavior well, even if exact match logic needs refinement. |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If MAE is low but RMSE is high:**\n",
    "  → The model works on most cases, but is failing in certain **threshold regions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If both MAE and RMSE are low but exact-match rate is below target:**\n",
    "  → The model’s **math logic is correct** but **rounding / step / quirk rules** need refinement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If Accuracy within ±$1 is high but EMR is low:**\n",
    "  → The model is *behaviorally close* but not yet **bitwise replicating** the legacy engine.\n",
    "  This is expected **before** quirk-capture rules are added.\n",
