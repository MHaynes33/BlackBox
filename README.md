# ACME Reimbursement Engine — Reverse Engineering Legacy Business Logic (working on the title)

### East Carolina University • Machine Learning / Data Science Graduate Project

*This repository showcases our full machine learning workflow for reverse engineering ACME’s legacy reimbursement engine. It includes all datasets, Jupyter notebooks, modeling scripts, and reports required to recreate the system and understand the underlying business logic, covering the complete analysis from Phase 1 through Phase 4.*

## I. Project Overview

ACME’s internal reimbursement engine has operated for over 60 years with undocumented formulas, nonlinear rules, hidden thresholds, department-specific quirks, and unpredictable rounding behaviors. The goal of this project was to **reverse engineer** this black-box system using quantitative analysis, qualitative insights, and machine learning.

Across four phases, our team:

-   Validated and explored ACME’s public/private reimbursement datasets, identifying receipts, mileage, and duration as the core statistical drivers of reimbursement.
-   Engineered efficiency-based features that capture diminishing returns, travel balance, and real-world spending behaviors.
-   Trained baseline and advanced nonlinear models, ultimately developing a **stacking ensemble** that most accurately replicated ACME’s historical outputs.
-   Interpreted the final model to reconstruct ACME’s underlying rules, confirming alignment with stakeholder interviews and PRD expectations.

The resulting model achieves **high predictive accuracy (\~0.95 R²)** while maintaining interpretability, providing ACME a modern, transparent foundation for replacing/recreating its legacy reimbursement engine.
